Final User:
The final user is someone interested in Delia Manastireanu's professional background and skills on make up and fashion.
The user may expect to find information about Delia's education, experience, career goals, and contact details, as well as visual elements that showcase her skills and personality.

Information Architecture:
I organized it in a single-page website where content is grouped into sections for Education, Experience, Career Goals, and Contact. 

Visual Design:
The color Palette that I used is a clear pinky one, I also use black to contrast and draw attention to important elements.
I used Roboto for the body and Courier New for strong elements to provide a clean and professional look.
Finally I centered the website content layout to the left for better readability.
